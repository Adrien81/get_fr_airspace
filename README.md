get_fr_airspace
===============

Gets latest France airspace from http://www.ffvvespaceaerien.org/?page_id=412
usage: ./get_fr_airspace.sh

The goal is to automatically download on one's computer the latest airspace for France.

Hopefully that could help someone make a permalink to that latest file, so that XCSoar can download it through embedded File Manager.
